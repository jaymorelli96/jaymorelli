      <description>Intro Welcome to my blog series Coding Challenges, where I will be documenting my thought process of working through the Coding Challenges by John Crickett using Go and Test Driven Development. I am very excited about this series as I have always wanted to find something similar to what John have done.
This is very different from the coding challenges you may have encountered before. John created a curated list of very interesting tools/applications, and I highly recommend you to check those out.</description>

      <description>Colt Technology Services May 2022 - June 2023 My time at Atos was over, I felt I needed to go to a bigger project and the salary didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my expectations. I got an job offer from Team IT, a Portuguese consultancy, to work as a contractor in Colt Technology Services at the SD-WAN project.
I find the world of networking very interesting and intimidating, which made me excited to work with SD-WAN even tough I knew that there were networking engineers who would deal with all the network was nice to be around that environment.</description>

      <description>Hi, welcome to my corner on the internet!
This site is a place for me to keep my own writting, a place for me to be a citizen of the web. Jammie Tanna and his article Why I Have a Website and You Should Too , was a big inspiration and really resonated with me.
I hope you can learn something from me as I have learned from many of the citizens of the web.</description>
