      <description>Intro Welcome to my blog series Coding Challenges, where I will be documenting my thought process of working through the Coding Challenges by John Crickett using Go and Test Driven Development. I am very excited about this series as I have always wanted to find something similar to what John have done.
This is very different from the coding challenges you may have encountered before. John created a curated list of very interesting tools/applications, and I highly recommend you to check those out.</description>
