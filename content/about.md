Hi, welcome to my corner on the internet! 

This site is a place for me to keep my own writting, a place for me to be a citizen of the web. 
Jammie Tanna and his article [Why I Have a Website and You Should Too](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/07/22/why-website/), was a big inspiration and really resonated with me.

I hope you can learn something from me as I have learned from many of the citizens of the web.

# TL;DR
I'm Jay Morelli, a devoted software engineer who finds joy in the art of craftsmanship. Specializing in Go, my favorite programming language, I'm currently working at Siemens in the Industrial Edge, where I have the opportunity to contribute to architectural decisions and thrive in a dynamic project team.

Besides work, you'll catch me fine-tuning my configurations, such as my NeoVim and terminal setup.  I also love learning and sharing my insights, which is part of the reason why I created this website. Outside the digital world, I enjoy playing board games with my fianc√©e and doing outdoor activities like surfing, running, or cycling.

For me, passion is the driving force that transforms the entire process into an enjoyable journey. 

# About me
## Background and education
#### Origin üèÅ
I'm a non-traditional Brazilian hailing from the vibrant country but defying stereotypes. While I may not share the typical Brazilian enthusiasm for football, funk, or carnival, my personality, often described as loud, aligns with the spirited nature of many Brazilians‚Äîas my fianc√©e loves to point out.

My educational journey took unexpected turns. In high school, I was a bit of a rebel, constantly landing my poor mom in meetings with the school principal. Unsure of my path, I initially pursued production engineering but quickly realized it wasn't my calling after just two weeks of classes.
#### Beyond Brazil üöÄ
Seeking a change, I left Brazil for various reasons‚Äînever truly feeling at home and fresh from a breakup. With an European passport in hand, I set off for Australia, the surfer's paradise.
#### Australia Adventures üèÑ
My time in Australia was a whirlwind of surfing and diverse jobs, from dishwasher and kitchen hand to strawberry farmer and even working on a crab boat. Amidst the adventure, a desire to keep going and surf fueled my pursuits.
#### The Irish Interlude ‚òòÔ∏è
I moved to Ireland with my Irish girlfriend at the time. Embracing the role of a barista, life was sweet with ample surf, nature, and coffee. Yet, I had an itch for something more significant. Quickly my interest in software engineering began to blossom.

#### The Software Engineering Journey üë®‚Äçüíª
I started with the classic trio, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The initial struggles with concepts like closures and recursion gradually transformed into a deep passion. One of my best memories of that time was when I created a simple quiz application, I couldn't believe that I created something like that. By far one my favorite aspects of programming is this quick feedback, you can quickly see the work that you have done and I find this feeling to be very rewarding.

My curiosity to understand the core of operating systems, the internet, data structures, and algorithms led me study computer science in Portugal.

#### Portugal üè†
In Portugal, I evolved into a dedicated student, sitting at the front, conquering math, and making my mom proud as one of the top students in the class. Today, Algarve is my home, where I live with my incredible fianc√©e, the most wonderful woman in the world! 

Our dream is to settle down near the ocean on a small farm along the picturesque west coast. Life has taken me on a unique journey, and I'm thrilled to continue growing personally and professionally in this beautiful corner of the world.

## Professional Journey
For a detailed overview of my professional experiences, the technologies I've mastered, and the projects I've contributed to, please visit my dedicated [CV]() page.

#### Atos IT
Fresh out of university, I chose to kickstart my career at Atos. The newly established Hub in Algarve, coupled with a compelling training program, made it a logical starting point. 

At Atos, I not only had the privilege of engaging in a dynamic learning environment but also benefited from robust support for certifications. In a short timeframe, I earned three certifications‚ÄîAzure Fundamentals, OCI Associate, and OCI Architect Associate. Additionally, I had the opportunity to lead a small team of trainees, an experience for which I am profoundly grateful, showcasing the trust placed in me.

#### Colt Technology Services
As a contractor for Colt Technology Services, I immersed myself in the SD-WAN project. With a genuine interest in networking, I found the project to be captivating. The energy within the team was great, and I met great people that I still keep contact. However, my desire to transition into working with Go became undeniable. The prospect of escaping Java stack traces and the sluggish startup times of Spring Boot was too enticing to resist.

#### Siemens Digital Industry
Presently, my professional journey unfolds at Siemens, where I contribute to the Industrial Edge project. In this role, I've actively shaped processes, contributed to developer and project documentation, and internal libraries. Working within a collaborative and supportive team at Siemens has been a source of great satisfaction. Recently, my best friend joined me in my team, adding an extra layer of fulfillment to my professional life.

My passion lies in crafting tools and libraries for developers. At Siemens, I've had the privilege of working on a parsing library utilizing ANTLR and another library integral to the core of our project's communication system. Every day is an opportunity to innovate and contribute to a cutting-edge project, and I couldn't be happier with the journey so far.

{{</html>}}
My peak productivity time is in the morning, making it ideal for deep-focus tasks. Preferably, let's schedule longer meetings post-lunch to maintain a steady workflow. Early standup meetings between 09:15 and 10:00 are optimal, allowing me to dive into problem-solving without interruptions.

I kickstart my day at around 07:00, dedicating this time to studies and personal projects. Depending on the workload, I might begin work before 09:00, but I always reserve time for personal growth.

        <blockquote>
    While they have lofty goals and ambitions, Advocates shouldn‚Äôt be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, and they‚Äôre rarely satisfied until they‚Äôve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear sense of their values, and they aim never to lose sight of what truly matters ‚Äì not according to other people or society at large, but according to their own wisdom and intuition.

Pursuing a certification provides a clear goal, serving as motivation to engage in focused study sessions. Successfully passing the exam brings a sense of accomplishment. Of course, the value of certifications is enhanced when supported by the company, especially considering their potential cost.
