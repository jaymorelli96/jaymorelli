Hi, welcome to my corner on the internet! 

This site is a place for me to keep my own writting, a place for me to be a citizen of the web. 
Jammie Tanna and his article [Why I Have a Website and You Should Too](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/07/22/why-website/), was a big inspiration and really resonated with me.

I hope you can learn something from me as I have learned from many of the citizens of the web.

# TL;DR
I'm Jay Morelli, a devoted software engineer who finds joy in the art of craftsmanship. Specializing in Go, my favorite programming language, I'm currently working at Siemens in the Industrial Edge, where I have the opportunity to contribute to architectural decisions and thrive in a dynamic project team.

Besides work, you'll catch me fine-tuning my configurations, such as my NeoVim and terminal setup.  I also love learning and sharing my insights, which is part of the reason why I created this website. Outside the digital world, I enjoy playing board games with my fianc√©e and doing outdoor activities like surfing, running, or cycling.

For me, passion is the driving force that transforms the entire process into an enjoyable journey. 

# About me
## Background and education
### Origin
I'm originally from Brazil but I am not really the typical Brazilian. I don't like football (soccer if you are American), funk or carnaval but as my fiancee like to point it out I am very a loud person as most Brazilians are. Also, I have left Brazil over 10 years ago and my family have also moved so I don't really have any attatchments there anymore.

//TODO: talk about study in brazil and that I wanted to study coputer science but I settled for engineering 
### Leaving Brazil
I left Brazil for many reasons. I never left like it was my home, went to a breakup and most important I didn't know what to do with my life when I finished high school. 

At that point I could only think about surfing and luckily I had an European passport so I decided to go to the surfers paradise, Australia.

I spent most of my time in Australia surfing and working at different sites, mostly doing dish washing and farm work. Learned a lot about being independent, different cultures //TODO

In Ireland I got a much better job than dish washing, I was a barista. Life was very good, plenty of great surf, nature and coffee. But still didn't know what I kind of profession I wanted to have. At that point I knew that I wanted to work remotely, so I started researching what kind of jobs would allow me to accomplish that. Quickly I realized that software developer was exactly what I was looking for, specially because studying Computer Science was something that I wanted to do in Brazil. 

Like most people who start studying software development I started with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I will never forget those times. Learning a for loop was hard, learning recursing was really hard. But the best memory is when I created a small quizz application, with a bare HTML page and JavaScript handling the logic. I couldn't believe it. I was so excited, showing everyone what I had accomplish, but I don't think they were as excited as I was when they used a bare HTML quizz, showing the answers in a browser alert window.

From that moment, I knew that this is what I wanted to be, to dedicate my life to be a professional software engineer. I knew that I could do a bootcamp or just keep learning by myself and I would eventually land a job but I really wanted to study computer science. I wanted to understand the foundations, how the operating system works, how the internet works, how data structure works, I wanted to learn everything. 

Now I had to find a place where I could study, surf and most important, afford the studies. Algarve, Portugal, checked every single box and little did I know that the love of my life would also move there at the same time.

### Portugal
When I started my studies I promised myself that I would be the best student and I that I would learn as much as I could. //TODO Talk about my dedication and how well I did and a bit more of my time in the university.

Portugal is my home now. We live in the beautiful Algarve, where the sun is always shining. Perfect place for a sunday cycle, surfing, and even watching a few races at the Autodramo de Portimao. Both of my family and my fiancee family lives in Algarve as well. I also spend most of my time speaking English than Portuguese, even though I live in Portugal and that is because my fiancee is from South Africa and at work we use English as we have an international team.

## Professional Journey
### Atos July 2021 - May 2022
At my last year in the university, Atos was opening a new branch in the Algarve with the idea of investing in the fresh graduates.It offered an interesting program, where the first 3 months was a trainee training program with focus on Agile, Domain-Driven Design, Cloud technologies, the Spring ecosystem, and Angular.

I also had the chance of doing three certifications: Azure Fundamentals, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Associate, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Associate.
#### Training Program
In a small agile team, we were tasked to create a weather web application using Spring Boot and Angular that would be deployed in Azure. The idea was to learn how to work with scrum, how to use an external API and develop a full stack application, and how to deploy an application in the Cloud. 
##### Technologies
- Java with Spring Boot
- Angular
- RabbitMQ
- Maven
- PostgreSQL
- Jenkins
- Azure

#### Project Management System R&D
There was a need of creating a project management system to evaluate risks and efforts of new projects. Me and my colleague were assigned to develop this application for the R&D department. 

Being a research and development project, we had a lot of freedom in the design of the application. I contributed in all aspects of the SDLC (software development life cycle), from writing down the technical and functional requirements documents to deploying the application. 

At that time I had recently learned about reactive programming and the Spring Webflux project, so we decided to use that along with MongoDB. The rest of the stack was pretty much similar from what I used in the trainee program. Because it was a small team, there were a lot of work to be done and it was very interesting learning about every stage of the SDLC.

#### Leading Trainees
Every 3 months a new group of trainees would go to the same process that I had been, and from my performance and attitude I got the opportunity to lead them where I received one-one guidance and training from my team leader. I'm very thankful for the opportunity and trust that was given to me.

### Colt Technology Services May 2022 - June 2023
My time at Atos was over, I felt I needed to go to a bigger project and the salary didn't meet my expectations. I got an job offer from Team IT, a Portuguese consultancy, to work as a contractor in Colt Technology Services at the SD-WAN project.

I find the world of networking very interesting and intimidating, which made me excited to work with SD-WAN even tough I knew that there were networking engineers who would deal with all the network was nice to be around that environment.
