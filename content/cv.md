### Colt Technology Services May 2022 - June 2023
My time at Atos was over, I felt I needed to go to a bigger project and the salary didn't meet my expectations. I got an job offer from Team IT, a Portuguese consultancy, to work as a contractor in Colt Technology Services at the SD-WAN project.

I find the world of networking very interesting and intimidating, which made me excited to work with SD-WAN even tough I knew that there were networking engineers who would deal with all the network was nice to be around that environment.

### Atos July 2021 - May 2022
At my last year in the university, Atos was opening a new branch in the Algarve with the idea of investing in the fresh graduates.It offered an interesting program, where the first 3 months was a trainee training program with focus on Agile, Domain-Driven Design, Cloud technologies, the Spring ecosystem, and Angular.

I also had the chance of doing three certifications: Azure Fundamentals, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Associate, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Associate.
#### Training Program
In a small agile team, we were tasked to create a weather web application using Spring Boot and Angular that would be deployed in Azure. The idea was to learn how to work with scrum, how to use an external API and develop a full stack application, and how to deploy an application in the Cloud. 
##### Technologies
- Java with Spring Boot
- Angular
- RabbitMQ
- Maven
- PostgreSQL
- Jenkins
- Azure

#### Project Management System R&D
There was a need of creating a project management system to evaluate risks and efforts of new projects. Me and my colleague were assigned to develop this application for the R&D department. 

Being a research and development project, we had a lot of freedom in the design of the application. I contributed in all aspects of the SDLC (software development life cycle), from writing down the technical and functional requirements documents to deploying the application. 

At that time I had recently learned about reactive programming and the Spring Webflux project, so we decided to use that along with MongoDB. The rest of the stack was pretty much similar from what I used in the trainee program. Because it was a small team, there were a lot of work to be done and it was very interesting learning about every stage of the SDLC.

#### Leading Trainees
Every 3 months a new group of trainees would go to the same process that I had been, and from my performance and attitude I got the opportunity to lead them where I received one-one guidance and training from my team leader. I'm very thankful for the opportunity and trust that was given to me.
