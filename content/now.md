This page is inspired by <span class="h-card"><a class="p-name u-url" href="https://sivers.org">Derek Sivers</a></span>'s post [_The /now page movement_](https://sivers.org/nowff) and [the Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about). The purpose of this page is to share what I'm currently focussed on, and will be updated as things change.

This is both for longer-lived interests and shorter-lived "what I'm currently doing".

What am I up to right now?

- Creating this website
- I'm currently at Siemens working on Industrial Edge
- I'm actively blogging about technical and personal things
- I'm looking to surf more often

What are my interests?

- Software Craftmanship
- Go
- Vim
- Linux
- Blogging
- Automation
- DevOps
- Open Source
