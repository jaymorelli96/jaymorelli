# Introduction
There is no need to complain about, working with Windows anymore. In fact, quite the contrary, Window Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is extremely powerful and if you want to work with Linux this is the best option for those who work with corporate companies and are willing to give out Windows or Mac machines.

You can have most of the distributions, including Arch Linux, OpenSUSE, Debian or Ubuntu
