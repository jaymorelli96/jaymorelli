#### Theme
- **Nord:** I love the color palette and the monochrome aspect. I can't imagine myself returning to a non-monochrome theme; the variety of colors tends to be distracting when programming.
#### Software
##### Operating System
- **OpenSUSE Tumbleweed**
##### Terminal
- **NeoVim**
- **zsh** with plugins:
  - z 
  - vim motion 
  - git 
  - zsh-highlighting 
- **lsd**
- **k9s**
- **bat**
##### Productivity
- **Obsidian**: Supports vim motions
- **Vimium**: Browser extenstion that provides keyboard shorcuts in the spirit of Vim

#### Hardware
- **Keychron K9 Pro 60%:** I absolutely love the support for QMK/VIA. I aim to align my keyboard as closely as possible with vim motions whenever feasible.
- **Logitech MX Master 3**
- **Single Monitor:** When programming, I prefer minimal distraction. Knowing keyboard shortcuts makes additional monitors unnecessary.
