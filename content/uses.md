#### Theme
- **Nord:** I love the color palette and the monochrome aspect. I can't imagine myself returning to a non-monochrome theme; the variety of colors tends to be distracting when programming.
#### Software
##### Operating System
- **OpenSUSE Tumbleweed**
##### Terminal
- **NeoVim**
- **zsh** with plugins:
  - z 
  - vim motion 
  - git 
  - zsh-highlighting 
- **lsd**: Replacement for ls
- **k9s**
- **bat**: Replacement for cat
- **jq**: JSON processor
##### Productivity
- **Komorebi**: A tilling window manager for Windows. Unfortunatelly I have to use Windows at work, but honestly with WSL and Komorebi it just feels like Linux for me.
- **Obsidian**: Supports vim motions
- **Vimium**: Browser extension that provides keyboard shortcuts in the spirit of Vim
##### Blogging
- **HUGO**
- **Cloudflare Pages**
- **GitHub**

#### Hardware
- **Keychron K9 Pro 60%:** I absolutely love the support for QMK/VIA, which let me change my keyboard shortcuts to keep as closely as possible with vim. 
- **Logitech MX Master 3**
- **Single Monitor:** When programming, I prefer minimal distraction. Knowing keyboard shortcuts makes additional monitors mostly unnecessary for me.
- **Sony WH-1000XM3**
