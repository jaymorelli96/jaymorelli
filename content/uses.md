#### Theme
- **Nord**: I love the color palette and the monochrome aspect
    - I can't imagine myself returning to a non-monochrome theme. I feel the variety of colors of a non-monochrome theme tends to be distracting when programming
    - I use the theme everywhere possible, this includes: NeoVim, terminal emulators, wallpaper/os theme, iphone, apple watch, and any other tools that allows theme customization
#### Software
##### Operating System
- **OpenSUSE Tumbleweed**: Both at home and in WSL
- **Windows with WSL**: At work I have to use Windows and I am very glad that WSL exists
##### Terminal
- **NeoVim**
- **zsh** with plugins:
  - z 
  - vim motion 
  - git 
  - zsh-highlighting 
- **lsd**: Replacement for ls
- **k9s**: Kubernetes TUI â€“ Built in Go, has dogs, and is a terminal tool. It couldn't get any better
- **bat**: Replacement for cat
- **jq**: JSON processor
##### Productivity
- **Komorebi**: A tiling window manager for Windows. WSL, combined with Komorebi, makes working with Windows significantly better.
- **Obsidian**: Moved from Notion to Obsidian mainly becaue of the support of vim motions. It is very customizable
- **Vimium**: Browser extension that provides keyboard shortcuts in the spirit of Vim
##### Blogging
- **HUGO**: This website is powered by HUGO. Super fast static generator built in Go
- **Cloudflare Pages**
- **GitHub**

#### Hardware
- **Keychron K9 Pro 60%:** I absolutely love the support for QMK/VIA, which let me change my keyboard shortcuts to keep as closely as possible with vim.
- **Logitech MX Master 3**
- **Single Monitor:** When programming, I prefer minimal distraction. Knowing keyboard shortcuts makes additional monitors mostly unnecessary for me.
- **Sony WH-1000XM3**
